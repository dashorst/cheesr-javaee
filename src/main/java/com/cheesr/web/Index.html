					<p wicket:id="description">Named after the Dutch town of Gouda,
						just outside Rotterdam. It accounts for more than 60% of the
						cheese produced in Holland and it has a very long history. Gouda
						is a traditional, creamery, hard cheese. It is round with very
						smooth, yellow, waxed rind. The flavor is sweet and fruity. As
						time passes, the taste intensifies and becomes more complex.
						Mature Gouda (18 months plus) is coated in black wax which
						provides a stark contrast to the deep yellow interior. Gouda is
						considered to be one of the world's great cheeses. It is both a
						table cheese and a dessert cheese, excellent with fruit and wine.
						Gouda is now made globally in a style similar to the creation of
						Edam.</p>
